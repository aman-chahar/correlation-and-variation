# Correlation and variance
The main objectives of the project were to clean the data, explore relationships between variables, and identify patterns.

Key steps in the project included:

Data cleaning and preprocessing, which involved removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values.
Calculation of correlation coefficients between variables to understand relationships.
Identifying features with high correlations and considering their impact on the analysis.
Feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
Utilizing Variance Threshold as a feature selection technique.
The project ultimately aimed to streamline the dataset, improve data quality, and identify essential features for future analysis. This is a valuable process in data science and machine learning to enhance the efficiency of models and uncover important insights. I look forward to sharing more about this project and its impact on data-driven decision-making."
